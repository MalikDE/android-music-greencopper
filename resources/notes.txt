Estimated time vs realtime:

- Read spec
- Design simple wireframes
- Investigate SDK spotify
- Setup project & imports
- Estimate time
=> estimate 2h    (real 4 => spotify SDK aar)

- Create test app
- Impl spotify sdk
- Test, fix & validation
=> 5h  (10h !! Spotify SDK was really hard to implement)


- Impl Domain use cases
- Map spotify results to a custom Model
- Test, fix & validation
=> 1h

- Create final App
- Impl Presenter
=> 1h

- Design UI interface from wireframes 
- Impl Design mockup
=> 4h 

- Documentation
- Git process
=> 2h (1)

=====> estimated 15 hours  
=====> real 21 hours

● Given more time and resources, how would you improve your application?
- More genericity to allow the app to grow up and to implement new features

● How did you approach the architecture of the app? What design pattern did you use?
- I used MVP. A presenter requests data and wrap it to simple object

● How hard was the assignment? How would you rate yourself?
- Not easy to implement Spotify SDK:
	- need premium account
	- Spotify Android SDK is not as documented as Web API. 
	- unspecified error 
- Little bit disappointed because I spend a lot of time trying to setup/implement the SDK
